# mowerApp
This is the (preliminary) app for a remote controlled lawnmower project.  
### Instructions
Opening the app will bring you to the connection page.  Here there are buttons meant to enable/connect to the desired bluetooth device, and a list on connected devices.  Tapping the chosen device will launch the controller code.
The controller page has four buttons (one for each direction), and a disconnect button.
